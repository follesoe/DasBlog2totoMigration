<p>I&#8217;m watching the PDC keynote <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/" target="_blank">live stream</a> at the moment. I was so impressed and inspired of the content presentment that I couldn't wait to tell you about it. Windows Azure was just announced, and it&#8217;s the Windows Operating System for the Cloud (internet). Azure is running upon several datacenters owned by Microsoft around the world (Windows container). This enables Azure to scale and guarantee uptime for your services in the cloud.</p>  <p>So we have this big operation system in the cloud, but what can we do with it? I like to think about Azure as an Operating system. It&#8217;s a platform where we can deploy services (WCF, SQL Services, Web applications etc) to the cloud - exactly like we can with a regular Windows OS. And this operating system will guarantee scalability and availability for your services. The .NET platform is also a part of Azure, and this enables you to leverage upon your existing .NET and C# skills. </p>  <p>Imagine you are about to start up a Web 2.0/3.0 company where your business model relay on your services in the cloud. Doing this requires lots of planning and money in order to build datacenters that will scale and handle the load from your users. Do you remember all the problems Twitter had about a year ago, when their services went up and down all the time? Azure has embedded patterns and best practices explored while developing large scale computing systems like Windows Live Search, Windows Live Messenger etc. While building your cloud services upon Azure you can utilize upon a system that will scale and be available.</p>  <p>Imagine how easy it will be to develop the next generation of Twitter based on .NET that will run upon Azure. You will have a platform that is guaranteed to scale and be available around the globe 24/7. The only think you need to think about is to develop your service and enable it for Azure. This will open a new area of services in the cloud. I think we might see a boom of companies that will base their services on Azure! I can&#8217;t wait to see where this is going! </p>  <p>I&#8217;m curious about the business model of Azure &#8211; how is Microsoft going to earn money on this product? </p>  <p>And I can only imagine what we can achieve with Azure together with Oslo. </p>  <p>You can follow Windows Azure on its public <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/azure/default.mspx" target="_blank">website</a> and the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cloud/" target="_blank">product team blog</a>.</p>  <p><em>I would also like to add that I'm not attending PDC, I'm sitting home monitoring live video streams, twitter and RSS feeds. So some of this information might not be 100 percent correct, it's my interpretation of content gathered from various sources.</em></p>
