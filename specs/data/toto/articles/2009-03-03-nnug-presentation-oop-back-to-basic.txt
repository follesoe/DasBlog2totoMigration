It’s more to it than polymorphism, encapsulation and inheritance.</p>  <p>If you manage to master the OO concept, you’ll be able to “reuse” your knowledge across various new technologies like Silverlight, WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), .NET, Java, Ruby on Rails and the list goes on. It doesn’t matter if you are coding C++, Ruby, C#, VB, or Java, all of them apply the same concept; OO. Yes, they have their differences, but that’s another story.</p>  <p>Not only will a deeper insight to OO help you learn technologies faster, it will help you to write better code. In my presentation I also talk about 3 of the 5 SOLID principles; <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf" target="_blank">SRP</a> (Single Responsibility Principle, <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf" target="_blank">DIP</a> (Dependency Inversion Principle) and <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf" target="_blank">OCP</a> (Open-Closed Principle). If you don’t know them, please learn them!!</p>  <p>You’ll find plenty of information about good design principles <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/publishedArticles.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
